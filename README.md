# BetImRight
Project 2 - Social Betting App

“Bet I’m Right” is an online version of social betting. Users can propose a bet based on any topic (sports, film, television, etc.), and other users accept the bet and provide their answer. Judging for the correct answer to a bet is determined through either the admin team, a chosen third party, or by seeing what the community thinks is the correct answer. Points and win history are kept in the database and can be referenced for other users to see.
